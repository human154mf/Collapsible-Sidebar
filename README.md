# Collapsible Sidebar

A **collapsible sidebar** is a side navigation panel that can expand or shrink as needed.  
When expanded, it displays full menus and text, while in its collapsed state it shows only icons.  

This design helps:
- Save space on the screen  
- Keep the interface clean and minimal  
- Provide flexibility for users to focus on content  

Ideal for dashboards, admin panels, or any application that requires efficient navigation.
